<h3>Aims and Scope </h3>
FluidsBench is a benchmark for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) surrogates, designed to accelerate progress in the development of foundational AI models for fluids. Motivated by similar efforts in weather (WeatherBench 2 [^1]) and early work on task specific efforts (CarBench [^2]), FluidsBench consists of an open-source evaluation framework, training and ground truth data available via external model hubs (e.g., HuggingFace), and a continuously updated website hosting the latest metrics and state-of-the-art leaderboards that will allow for testing of more general foundational models. In-person and virtual workshops will be held at popular fluids and ML events (e.g NeurIPS, ICML, ML4Fluids) to discuss the latest work and get community direction for this benchmarking effort.
