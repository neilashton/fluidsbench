With some organisations tightening up on travel, to widen the participation and impact of the workshop series, we will also make available a simple Teams meeting. Through the Teams Meeting you will be able to follow the workshop remotely and have the ability to ask questions, although we make no guarantees on the quality of the video and audio. There will be no charge for attending the workshop through Teams. We will be distributing the meeting details through the AutoCFD mailing list, so if you are interested please make sure you sign up. You can also e-mail admin@fluidsbench.org for the Teams meeting information if you haven't received via the mailing list.
